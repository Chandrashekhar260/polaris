You are an expert AI systems developer.  
Build a full-stack intelligent AGENT called “Personal Learning AI Agent” that runs from Replit as a backend service and connects to my local VS Code (or any IDE) to monitor learning activity in real time.

---

### 🎯 PURPOSE

The agent should automatically:
1. Detect the user’s learning or coding activity (via a local watcher/extension that syncs file updates to the Replit backend).
2. Analyze what the user is doing — the code, comments, notes, or error logs.
3. Use the **Gemini API** to:
   - Understand the learning context
   - Identify struggles or repeated mistakes
   - Suggest specific learning materials, docs, or tutorials
   - Summarize the user’s progress
4. Store everything in a vector database for personalized learning memory.
5. Display insights and suggestions on a modern web dashboard.

### 🧩 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**Agent Components:**

1. **Agent Core (Backend – Replit):**
   - Written in Python (FastAPI)
   - Uses LangChain for orchestration
   - Integrates Google Gemini API for summarization & suggestions
   - Uses ChromaDB or FAISS for local vector search
   - Provides REST API endpoints:
     - `/analyze` → for live analysis updates
     - `/recommend` → for learning suggestions
     - `/summary` → for progress and topic summaries

2. **Local Watcher (VS Code Extension or CLI script):**
   - A small Node.js or Python script that runs locally
   - Watches the user’s code directory for file saves
   - Sends file content + metadata via HTTPS POST to Replit backend (`/analyze`)
   - Keeps running silently as user codes or learns

3. **Frontend Dashboard (React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui):**
   - Displays:
     - Current topics being learned
     - Detected problem areas
     - Suggested docs/resources
     - Weekly AI summaries
     - Progress timeline or charts
   - Uses Axios to fetch data from Replit backend

### ⚙️ TECH STACK

**Backend (Replit):**
- Python
- FastAPI
- LangChain
- ChromaDB / FAISS

### 🧠 FUNCTIONAL FLOW

1. **User edits or saves a file in VS Code.**
2. **Local watcher** detects the change → sends updated text & filename to **Replit backend API**.
3. **Replit backend (FastAPI)**:
   - Stores the snippet in ChromaDB
   - Sends content to **Gemini API**
   - Gemini analyzes:
     - What topic the file relates to
     - What the user seems to be learning
     - Any errors, patterns, or struggle indicators
   - Generates a short summary + recommendations
4. Backend updates the database with:
   - Topic tags
   - Summary
   - Suggested resources
5. **Frontend dashboard** fetches updates via `/summary` and displays:
   - Ongoing learning journey
   - Weak topics
   - Suggested tutorials/videos/articles
   - Weekly AI study plan
